LOL Thing for WebDev

Going to use README as a mailbox for notes when I think of things:

I think we need to add a small time delay, because when I run this on small sample sizes it turns out okay. might need to add like a .2 second delay between each request or smth. We only get 10 per second.

Match history looks fairly easy to parse for information. I've implemented a fairly basic match history for the time being. What information from the match should we be including? It also needs to be styled.

Going to get ready for work.

**JK:**Also need to make an empty item slot image
